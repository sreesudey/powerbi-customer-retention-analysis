# Project Brief: Customer Value & Retention Dashboard

## Overview

This Power BI project aims to analyse customer behaviour for a fictional eCommerce company. The goal is to uncover insights about customer lifetime value (CLTV), churn patterns, and operational factors like shipping delays and returns â€” ultimately helping stakeholders improve retention and profitability.

---

## Business Questions

- Which customers provide the highest lifetime value?
- How many customers are churning, and what are their traits?
- Are there seasonal or cohort-based retention patterns?
- Does shipping delay correlate with product returns or churn?
- Which age groups and countries bring the most revenue?

---

## Objectives

- Calculate and segment customers by CLTV
- Identify churned customers using time-based logic
- Analyse retention cohorts by signup month
- Visualise trends in sales, returns, and shipping delays
- Build an interactive dashboard to support stakeholder decisions

## Data Sources

All data is synthetic and stored in CSV format:

| File         | Description                                       |
